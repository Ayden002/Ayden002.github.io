                    <h1>Motivation/Study Choice</h1>
                    <p>At first, a large part of the reason I chose to study this was that I yearned for the IT industry
                        when I was a child. I felt that typing code made me feel like a hacker, and as I grew older,
                        I gradually realized that IT nowadays is everywhere. Computer programming languages are
                        used in many places. Learning here is more about practice and operation, without a lot of
                        theoretical knowledge and written examinations.</p>

                    <p>I was injured in a game two years ago. At that time, I felt that my life was coming to an end. I
                        couldn't do what I loved anymore. I kept myself in the room for two months without studying or
                        socializing. I vent my emotions by overeating and playing computer games, but my teacher has
                        always encouraged me to get out of the shadows and asked me to study in a country I always
                        wanted to go to. In the end, I chose HZ University of Applied Sciences and took HBO-ICT courses.
                        I know that studying this major will be very difficult, especially for students who have no
                        experience, but this has also become my motivation. I have to prove to myself that as long as I
                        persist, I can do a lot of things.</p>

                    <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
                    <p>I didn’t have any programming experience before September 7, 2021. My first programming
                        started at 10 am on September 8, 2021, which is a month ago. That was the first time I clicked
                        on
                        "Preparation Course". And started programming in the true sense for the first time in my life.

                    <h3>Personal SWOT Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I am best at focusing on one thing. When I am sure what I want to accomplish, I can turn all my
                        attention to what I need to do without being interfered by external factors, and I am very
                        willing to help others. At the same time, I am a person who is willing to accept criticism from
                        others. I think these suggestions can make me better.My weakness is that I sometimes feel very
                        hesitant, and I can’t determine by myself whether it’s the right thing to do. For example, when
                        I was working on my homework and encountered an answer that I was not sure whether it was
                        correct or not, my first reaction was not to determine it by myself but to ask other people,
                        which greatly delayed my study time.</p>
                    <p>Acknowledge and accept my weaknesses. If     you are busy denying the existence of weaknesses, you
                        cannot turn weaknesses into strengths.Carelessness is a big problem for me. Being careless in my
                        previous exams will cost me a large part of my scores. This problem will also affect my future
                        career, especially in programming languages.In my free time, I also try to find a part-time job,
                        but I prefer to find a job related to my major after studying the HBO-ICT course.</p>
